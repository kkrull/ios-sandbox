# Swift CLI Bootstrap

Source: <https://www.swift.org/getting-started/cli-swiftpm/>

## Initialize

```shell
swift package init --name Greet --type executable
```

## Run

```shell
$ swift run Greet
Building for debugging...
[8/8] Applying Greet
Build of product 'Greet' complete! (24.22s)
Hello, world!
```

It eventually runs, but it takes so long I was wondering if it was stuck.
